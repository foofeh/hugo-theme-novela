<center><i>Above is the Pinterest Trends homepage. You can see what is trending in popular categories.</i></center>
<br>

On the homepage of Pinterest Trends is a high-level report on what keywords are currently trending.

The first panel, <i><b>Today's Top Pinterest Trends</i></b>, shows keywords that had a recent surge in searches. As you scroll down, Pinterest breaks out trending keywords by popular categories: Fashion, Food & Drink, Beauty, and Home.


Pinterest Trend's home page is great for a high-level of what is trending on Pinterest. Should you have a specific keyword you want to research, Pinterest offers a search function.
<br>
<br>
<center><h2>Pinterest Keyword Research: Getting Started<h2></center>
 
I run a baking community on Pinterest. My content plan switches off between featuring cakes and cookies. Using Pinterest Trends reporting, I can identify when it is best to post cookie content v.s cake content.

 <center><i>Pinterest auto-suggest keywords based off what you type in. On the right of the keyword is a search volume graph.</i></center>
<br>
Using the search bar is a great way to quickly get new keyword ideas and see keyword performance at a glance.
<br>
 <b>Step 1:</b> Type in a keyword you would like to explore.
 <br>
 <b>Step 2: </b> Pinterest auto-suggests keyword ideas in the drop-down menu.
 <br>
 <b>Step 3:</b> In the right corner of every keyword is a search volume graph. This shows search volume for that keyword over the last 12 months. 
 <br>
 <b>Step 4:</b> Click on the keyword you want to explore. You will be navigated to a new page for a deeper-dive into search volume.

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/PTOvertimeGraph.png" width="80%" height="80%"></center>
<Center><i> Hovering over the graph allows you to see search volume for each week. </center></i>
<br>
The main part of the Pinterest Trends tool is an interactive graph. Providing data from the last 12 months, each data point is searches over a week.

<i>Important note:</i> The search volume is not the <b><i>actual</b></i> search volume. Instead, Pinterest provides a score from 0-100 that is relative to other keyword searches during the same time period. The higher the search volume number, the more searches there are compared to other searches.
<br>
A search volume score of 90 has more searches than a keyword with a score of 20. 
<br>
<br>
<center><h3>Comparing Keywords</center></h3>
Being able to compare keywords enables you to take your content strategy to the next level. Knowing <i>what</i> people are searching for <i>when</i> allows you to provide relevant content during popular search windows.
<br>
<br>
<center><h4> How To Use the Interactive Graph</center></h4>
Pinterest allows you to add up to 4 keywords at a time.
You can add keywords to the graph in following ways:

<b>Related Terms</b>: Below the interactive graph are related terms Pinterest suggests. Simply click on they keyword and it will be added to the graph.

<b>Search Bar</b>: Going back up to the search bar, you can type in a new keyword. A list of suggestions based off of what you typed in will pop-up. Once you found the keyword you want, simply click on it to add to the graph.
<br>
<br>
<center><h4>Keyword Comparision Example </h4></center>
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/PTKeywordCompare.png" width="80%" height="80%"></center>
<center><i> Above is the Search Volume Graph I will be walking through in this example.</center></i>.
<br>
On Pinterest I post content related to cake and cookie baking. Being two different topics, I wanted to see if there was a time period where one is searched more than the other.
<br>
Knowing if cakes are searched more than cookies during a certain time can help me strategize my content.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Setting Up to Compare Keywords</h4>
To start off, I searched for <i>cake decorating</i> on the homepage. I was then taken to the Search Volume Interactive graph. 
<br>
Immeditately, I typed in  <i>cookie decorating</i> in the search bar, and added it to the graph.
<br>
<br>
Taking a look across both search volume lines, <i>cake decorating</i> has a search volume index that is almost always 6-8 times higher than <i>cookie decorating</i>!
<br>
People on Pinterest are searching for cake decorating more often than cookie decorating.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Looking For Keyword Search Volume Jumps </h4>
However, I did notice something interesting..
<br>
Right around Christmas, <i>cookie decorating's</i> search volume line jumped! <i>Cookie decorating</i> had a search volume index of 70, while <i>cake decorating</i> had an index of 28.
<br>
People were searching for cookies <i>much</i> more frequently around Christmas.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Cookies are much more popular than cakes around Christmas.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Taking Keyword Research a Step Further </h4>

Royal icing is a type of frosting that is often used for cookie decorating. Ever see one of those memorizing cookie decorating videos? Yup. They're using royal icing.
<br>
<br>
Knowing that royal icing and cookie decorating goes hand-in-hand, I added <i>royal icing</i> to the graph.
<br>
..and I saw that royal icing is by far the highest searched keyword around Christmas! <i>Royal Icing</i> had a search volume index of 100 while <i>cookie decorating</I> had a search volume index of 70.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Using Keyword Research to Plan Content</h4>
Now how might I use this information to plan out content?
<br>
<br>
Starting in December, I would start posting content related to royal icing and cookie decorating. I would be sure to not over-populate my feed with cookie content, however. Some of my followers may prefer cake baking over cookies. Not wanting to isolate that audience, I would sprinkle in cake content as well.
<br>
<br>
Cookies becoming more popular than cakes around Christmas is an extreme example. Depending on your industry, you may not see such large differences between keywords. That's ok! Optimizing for smaller gaps can still prove to be impactful to your Pinterest Performance.
